# About
This repository serves as a place to host my template GameMaker 2023 C++ extension project, alongside other smaller extensions I've made!

# Usage
You can use the template by modifying `main.cpp` and compiling, the resulting `.dll` file should automatically be copied into the `project`'s `extensions` directory. By default, the extension uses a generic "Library" name  

# Extensions
This repository also includes miscellaneous built extensions in the `packaged` folder, each having their own README.md
